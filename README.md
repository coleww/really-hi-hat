# REALLY-HI-HAT

a web audio hi-hat synth, inspired by [Synthesizing Hi-Hats with Web Audio by Joe Sullivan](http://joesul.li/van/synthesizing-hi-hats/)













# DEVELOPMENT

```
npm install
npm run test # should pass! Yay!
```

# HEAR THE MAGIC!

- `npm run serve` boot a webserver at port 3000
- `npm run build` build demo.js to a bundle. Run this after making any changes to hear updates (or add [watchify](https://github.com/wham-js/web-audio-advent-calendar/blob/master/package.json#L8), i wanted to keep things "light")
- open `http://localhost:3000/` in a web browser and hear the magic (hopefully)
